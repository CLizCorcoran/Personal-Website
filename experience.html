          There is a media query that helps with the sizing of the 
            carousel pages.  As the user reduces the size of the browser
            window, the carousel item's height will grow.

            <p>Jan 2004 – April 2013: I was a lead designer and developer on a report rendering engine. Reports were
              generated when running SAS code or through other products such as SAS Web Report Studio. I was also a lead
              participant of the architecture committee for the design of the report specification. Collaborated with
              other teams generating the report syntax to educate on syntax, find problems and assist any way I could.

            <p>June 1996 – April 2002: Enterprise Guide will always be near and dear to my heart as I was one of the
              founding developers. During this stint, I was responsible for the overall architecture of the product and
              worked on infrastructure code. (C++, C#)</p>

            <p>April 2013 – June 2020: Managed a team of 4-6 developers to create, promote, and maintain a dynamic user
              interface rendering engine. This was known as SAS Studio Tasks. Tasks were written in an XML specification
              known as the <a href="http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings15/SAS1831-2015.pdf"
                target="_blank"><b>Common Task Model</b></a>. Tasks could render a variety of smart prompts which could
              retrieve information from the SAS sever. SAS Studio shipped with a variety of tasks written within SAS;
              however, the ability to write tasks was also available to customers. (JavaScript, Dojo and SAPUI5
              frameworks, Java, CSS, XML)</p>

            <p>Although I loved working at SAS and am grateful for the many opportunities I had along
              the way, it was time to move on. As a lifelong learner, I was eager
              to learn new things and tackle new challenges. Technically, I retired from the company. I do not however,
              consider myself retired from a work life.
            </p>
            <p>After retiring, I start a series of self-learning exercises. I went through tutorials on AWS, React, MySQL,
              Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. Wanting a more structured program, I
              signed up for a Web Development Bootcamp through Northeastern Illinois University / Quickstart. This program
              refreshed and enhanced my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
              In addition, I was exposed to jQuery, Bootstrap, Python, React, AngularJs, and MySQL. Several projects were
              worked on throughout the course as well as a final capstone project.
