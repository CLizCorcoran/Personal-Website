# Personal Website for Christie Corcoran
## Overview
This website is meant to introduce potential employers to Christie's background as well as her present ambitions.  

It was written for her Web Development class to showcase some of her knowledge of HTML and CSS as well as her initial learnings of Bootstrap.  

## About the Website
The website consists of three pages - Wecome, Experience, and Contact

### Welcome
The Welcome page introduces the user to Christie and a summary of her history.  

### Experience
The Experience page details Christie's experience on major projects she's worked on throughout the years as well as what she is up to today.  

### Contact
The Contact page allows the user an opportunity to get in touch with Christie.  It should be noted that the Submit button does not actually send an email yet.  

## Technologies Used
This website was build using HTML and CSS.  Bootstrap was also imported and is used in several instances (general default theming and carousel).  No JavaScript was harmed in the making of this Website.  

## Future improvements
- Add list of skills to the Experience page.  As the user scrolls through the carousel, the skills used in that project are bolded.  
- Get the submit button working with sending an email  
- The styling still needs more attention.  The carousel item heights are all a bit different so there is some jumping around.  It would be nice if the tallest carosel item won for all.  
- The CSS could use some cleanup.  Normalizing naming conventions, seperating out css files per page, and utilizing Sass would all help tidy things up a bit.
