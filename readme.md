# Personal Website for Christie Corcoran
## Overview
This website is meant to introduce potential employers to Christie's background as well as her present ambitions.  

It was written for her Web Development class to showcase some of her knowledge of HTML and CSS as well as her initial learnings of Bootstrap (Bootstrap 4 is the version used).  

## User Stories
As a recruiter, I would like to get to know this candidate better so that I can see if they are a good match for the job I am looking to fill.

As a small business owner, I am interested in getting more information from this freelance web designer to see how they could build my company’s website.  

As a young professional, I am interested in learning more about Christie to see if she would be a good mentor.  


## About the Website
The website consists of three pages - Welcome, Experience, and Contact.  

### Welcome
The Welcome page introduces the user to Christie and a summary of her history.  It uses a two column layout which wraps when the page is reduced in size.  

### Experience
The Experience page details Christie's experience on major projects she's worked on throughout the years as well as what she is up to today.  This page utilizes the Bootstrap 
carousel component - it has 3 slides.  Note that the carousel height changes as the browser window's size is reduced.  

### Contact
The Contact page allows the user an opportunity to get in touch with Christie.  It should be noted that the Submit button does not actually send an email yet.  Instead, the user
will get a pop up modal dialog informing them that this feature it not yet working.  

## Technologies Used
This website was build using HTML and CSS.  Bootstrap was also imported and is used in several instances (general default theming and carousel).  No JavaScript was harmed in the making of this Website.  

## Future improvements
- Add list of skills to the Experience page.  As the user scrolls through the carousel, the skills used in that project are bolded.  
- Get the submit button working with sending an email  
- The styling still needs more attention.  
- The CSS could use some cleanup.  Normalizing naming conventions, separating out css files per page, and utilizing Sass would all help tidy things up a bit.
