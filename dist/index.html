        <p id="aboutme"><b><i>Welcome to my site!</i> I have been in the software development world for over 28 years.
            Working with others to build amazing products is my passion. Every player of the product lifecycle is
            critical to its success. I find joy in seeing everyone come to the table. My passion for collaborating with
            others has sustained me in this field that can at times be grueling with pressure and deadlines. In the end,
            the taste of sweet success with a team that is a second family is worth all the effort. </b></p>
        <p>I stumbled into programming while in college at North Carolina State University (Go Wolfpack!). Not knowing
          what to major in, Computer Science felt different from the other Engineering curriculums I was considering. My
          first class was love at first sight. I was fortunate to find a co-op at IBM and had several fabulous
          development rotations there getting to work on products such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISPF" target="_blank">ISPF</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Cross_System_Product" target="_blank">CSP</a>, and even producing and supporting
          my own internal IBM tool translating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_diagram#Bachman_diagram" target="_blank">Bachman diagrams</a> into natural text. </p>
        <p>Upon graduation, I landed a job at SAS, a company well renowned for their data analytics and amazing
          work-life balance. The next 20 years flew by as I worked on the Base SAS platform as well as exciting products
          such as SAS Enterprise Guide and SAS Studio. There were also a few failed projects along the way but that is
          all part of the R in R&D. Eventually though, I was itching for change. I had been asked on several occasions
          to consider management and this time, I agreed. There, I discovered and developed skills I never thought
          possible. The thrill of having a team, discovering their strengths and weaknesses, and then capitalizing on
          those strengths to deliver high-quality software invigorated me. </p>
        <p>Eight years later however found me itching for change again. I believe in lifelong learning and I become
          anxious if Iâ€™m not learning and growing. So, in a year where everyone felt upside down, I retired from SAS in
          June, 2020. This is the beginning of my next chapter. </p>
        <p>What can I do for you? </p>
